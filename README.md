# Semantic Segmentation using ACDG Data
## Setup
### w&b
Export your w&b API key prior to running a training job using: `export WANDB_API_KEY=<your api key>`
### Docker
Modify the `docker/compose.yaml` file to mount your data to the container and change any training settings you wish.`
### Data
You can use semantic segment generated by ACDG from your own ACI recordings.
Alternatively, the set of training data used to train models referenced in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00358) can be downloaded [here](https://www.adelaideautonomous.racing/downloads/)

## Run
A training job can be run in docker using the command `bash train.sh`.
